Summary:
========

This document provides the integration build steps of u-boot and the Broadcom 
Minidriver Development Kit (MDK) for BCM53012/BCM53011/BCM53010.
The MDK is compiled into u-boot, an additional 'mdk' command is installed.
Example of starting up MDK in u-boot shell is also described in this document.


Build Steps:
============
Environment parameter setup and the build directory are the same as building an
u-boot only image. 

To integrate the MDK, the environment variable that points to MDK source tree
has to be set. For example:
	$> export MDK="~/brcm/mdk-2.7.1"
	
Rules to build the images for BCM53012/BCM53011/BCM53010 are pre-defined in the
main Makefile of u-boot source directory. For example, the rule for BCM53012 can
be found in the Makefile as,
	mdk-bcm53012:
        	$(MAKE) CFG_MDK_DEBUG=1 CFG_LITTLE=1 MDK_CFLAGS="-DCDK_CONFIG_INCLUDE_FIELD_INFO=0 -DCDK_CONFIG_INCLUDE_BCM53012" ubootmdk

To build the images of corresponding chips, run:
	$> make O=./build-output mdk-bcm53012
	$> make O=./build-output mdk-bcm53011
	$> make O=./build-output mdk-bcm53010
	
To clean the build, run:
	$> make O=./build-output cleanmdk
	

MDK command in u-boot:
======================
To start up the MDK, it is required to probe if a supported chip exists. It
is done by,
	u-boot> mdk probe
	
Then enter the MDK shell to access MDK shell commands.
	u-boot> mdk shell
	MDK.0>
	
Refer to MDK release documents for detailed information of MDK shell commands. 

To return to the u-boot shell, type exit or quit at the MDK prompt.
